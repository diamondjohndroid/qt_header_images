Belinda  walks in, and sees Daniela siting in a chair with a low back, in the middle of the room, wearing her ballet outfit, exposing her neck.
Belinda lights some candles, with the scents of Danielas favourite essential oils, creating a soothing & comforting aroma. 
The room is warm. Belinda dims the lights and plays soft, calming music. 

Belinda walks up to the chair, and stands behind Daniela. Beinda tenderly pushes Daniels head forward, further exposing her neck.

Belinda bends to Danielas ear, and whispers, "SHhhhhh. Just enjoy, dont say a word. I want you to feel completely relaxed and at ease, and enjoy the massage."

Belinda places both palms on the back of Danielas neck, with her fingers spread apart and into her hair line.
Daniela feels Belinda's thumbs, knead fgirmly at the base of her neck, as Belindas fingernails lightly graze on the skin, within Daniela's hair line
Belinda then edges her hands, thumbs and fingers a little higher up, further into Daniela's hairline.
Belinda's fingers and nails trace slow and soft circles on the back of Danielas scalp.

After a few minutes of slowly moving her hanbds up the back of Danielas scalp, Belinda repositions her hands, so that one hand is across he forehead, with her thumb on one tenmpole and her fingers on the other, painting slow and firm circles on both temples, while her other hand firmly piches either side, of the rear base of Daniela's neck.

Belkinda then returns to behind Daniela, and places her hands on Danielas outer shoulders, Daniela uses the full width of her hands to massage Daniela. Belinda slowly moves each hand symetrically towards Daniela's neck, finally focussing on her shoulders at the back of her neck.

The massage ends after a maximum of 15 minutes.
